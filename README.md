phototate
=========
Phototate is a super simple Python script I created to make rotating photos in batch much easier. I found that when I uploaded photos to shldz.us some of them were rotated in odd ways, and needed to be fixed individually. I created this tool so that I could rotate them to the correct orientation in batch, which saved me a lot of time and headaches. I wrote it in Python because I'd never done any Python development and wanted to learn.
